This portfolio is designed to showcase my skills and experience, my achievements and what I have learned throughout ICS4U. Here you will find a collection of projects that demonstrate my abilities in areas such as front-end, back-end, algorithms, natural simulations. Additionally, you will find information about my learning experience, course work and other relevant information.

The projects section of the portfolio includes a variety of different projects that I have worked on from both Khan Academy and Codecademy.
